# Multi-model Multi-domain Image-to-Image translation
A deep generative model for performing image-to-image translations between multiple weather domains.

## Pretrained weights
The pretrained weights can be downloaded from the links below:
* WeatherTranslation : comming soon

## Generating Images
To checkout translated image generation follow the steps:
* Download the pretrained weights.
* run sample.sh
```
bash ./sample.sh
```
## Train the model
There is a shell script file for training the model (train.sh). Edit the required paths in the script and run:
```
bash ./train.sh
```
